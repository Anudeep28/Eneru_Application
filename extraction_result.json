We’re looking forward to sharing our results in a moment. So, I’d like to start by thanking our 43,000 Casey’s team members for their tireless efforts and contribution to a record fiscal year. As I reflect on the three-year strategic plan that we set out in January of 2020, I’m extremely proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish. Casey’s is at the heart of the communities we serve. Our teams give their all and this shows in the positive guest feedback we receive, the delicious food we make and the impact we have on our communities. In fiscal year ’23, Casey’s, along with our generous guests and committed supplier partners, enabled over $5 million of donations. These dollars provided meals, school supplies, new playgrounds and equipment, disaster recovery needs and services helping veterans and their families. I’d like to offer a huge thank you to our team members, our guests and our non-profit and supplier partners that make this all possible. We are proud to do so much good across so many communities. Speaking of good, in early May, we launched an upgrade to our rewards program that’s bringing more good to our 6.5 million loyal members. The enhanced Casey’s Rewards experience includes a refreshed app design that makes it easier than ever for Casey’s Rewards members to track their points, redeem their full rewards and see how much money they save by shopping with Casey’s Rewards. The program recently celebrated its three-year anniversary, and what guests love most about our loyalty program is the way they can choose to receive their rewards. Whether it’s Casey’s Cash to help pay for pizza night or extra cents off when filling the family vehicle, members have the flexibility to decide what works best for them. We look forward to continuing to grow membership and participation. Now let’s discuss results of the past fiscal year. Fiscal ’23 was a record year for diluted EPS finishing at $11.91 a share, a 31% increase from the prior year. The company also generated a record $447 million in net income and $952 million in EBITDA, an increase of 19% from the prior year. Inside same-store sales were up 6.5% or 13.6% on a two-year stack basis with strong results in both prepared food and dispensed beverage as well as grocery and general merchandise, with same-store sales up 7.1% and 6.3% respectively. Margins were virtually flat year-over-year, a tremendous accomplishment as we managed cost increases with our merchandise partners and commodities, while still holding our value proposition for our guests. We saw tremendous results across the board. Pizza slices and alcoholic beverages were very strong. We also had a lot of fun with innovative products like Busch Light Beer Cheese Breakfast Pizza that made a positive impact on sales. Fuel gross profit was up 16%, with total fuel gallons sold up 4% and fuel margin averaging $0.402 per gallon over the course of the year. Our fuel team continues to do an excellent job maximizing gross profit dollars by balancing fuel volume and margin. The macro environment was especially favorable for fuel margins with two significant wholesale fuel cost declines during the year. We also had a great year in terms of managing costs. Same-store operating expenses, excluding credit card fees, were up only 2.8%, impacted favorably by a reduction of same-store labor hours of 2.3%. Guest satisfaction scores still improved, which is a testament to our store simplification and store leadership teams. They’ve been effective at freeing up unproductive and more expensive labor hours, which enables our team members to better serve our guests. During the fiscal year, we also did a tremendous job with unit growth. We built 34 new stores and acquired 47 more, which demonstrates our ability to grow the business both organically and via M&A. We met our annual and our three-year growth targets despite challenges with permitting as well as delays in construction materials and equipment due to supply chain disruptions. We’re successfully integrating the 228 new units from fiscal 2022 and are meeting our synergy targets from those new stores. All of this wouldn’t be possible without our store development, real estate and integration teams working seamlessly to grow our store base. We’re extremely confident in our ability to continue to build and buy new units. We believe consolidation will continue to occur in the industry, while rising financing costs are reducing the number of potential buyers. Our private label program continues to be popular with our guests and we ended the fiscal year above 9% penetration in the grocery and general merchandise category in both units and gross profit. We currently offer over 300 SKUs of private label products, which we believe is a tremendous value proposition for our guests. These record-breaking financial results are a strong reminder that our business model is resilient in all parts of the economic cycle and that Casey’s has unique ability to provide value and quality to our guests. I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve to discuss the fourth quarter and our outlook for fiscal ’24.

Before I jump into the financials, I’d also like to acknowledge the entire Casey’s team to the excellent financial results for the quarter, the year and the three-year strategic plan are significant accomplishments for the entire organization, and it would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our team members. Total inside sales for the quarter rose 8.4% from the prior year to over $1.1 billion with an average margin of 39.6%. For the quarter, total grocery and general merchandise sales increased by $66 million to $810 million, which is an increase of 8.8%, and total prepared food and dispensed beverage sales rose by $21 million to $314 million, an increase of 7.1%. Same-store grocery and general merchandise sales were up 7.1%. And the average margin was 33%, an increase of 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. Sales were particularly strong in our non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages and we experienced a favorable mix shift in these categories as single-serve grab-and-go items outperformed. Energy drinks sold exceptionally well, driving non-alcoholic beverages up over 13% in the quarter. Ongoing private label growth also assisted this category. Same-store prepared food and dispensed beverage sales were up 4.9% for the quarter. The average margin for the quarter was 56.8%, down 10 basis points from a year ago. Bakery as well as hot food performed well in the quarter. Margin was adversely affected by a higher LIFO charge than prior year, which had an impact of roughly 50 basis points. And while we did experience some cost pressure in bakery and proteins, cheese costs were down $0.06 per pound from the prior year to $2.20. This had an approximately 20 basis point benefit to margin. During the fourth quarter, same-store fuel gallons sold were flat with a fuel margin of $0.346 per gallon, down approximately $0.016 per gallon compared to the same period last year. Fuel margins varied widely in the quarter. For example, we experienced a low-$0.30 per gallon in both February and March, but in April, CPGs were closer to $0.40 a gallon. Our flat same-store sales outperformed our relevant OPIS geographic data by over 200 basis points. Retail fuel sales were down $207 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to an 11% decrease in the average retail price from $3.77 last year to $3.36 a gallon. This was partially offset by a 2.4% increase in total gallons sold to $636 million. Total operating expenses were up 6.3% to $31 million in the fourth quarter. Approximately 1.5% of the increase is due to operating 69 more stores than a year ago. Approximately 2% of the increase was related to same-store operations. Finally, approximately 1% of the change is related to an increase in the accrued costs for variable incentive compensation due to strong financial performance. Same-store employee expense was flat as the increase in employee wage rate was offset by a 3.3% reduction in same-store labor hours. The company also benefited from a $2 million reduction in credit card fees due to lower retail prices of fuel. Depreciation in the quarter was up modestly as we put a large number of stores into service late in the quarter. Net interest expense was $12.8 million in the quarter and that’s down $2.5 million versus the prior year. This reduction was aided by rising interest rates on our cash balances. And as a reminder, only 15% of our debt is floating rate. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% compared to 17.8% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a one-time benefit in the prior year from adjusting our deferred tax liabilities for a corporate rate drop that was enacted by the State of Nebraska. Net income was down slightly versus the prior year to $56.1 million, a decrease of 6%, and EBITDA for the quarter was $166 million and that’s essentially flat with the prior year. During the quarter, we refinanced our credit facility with an unsecured $1.1 billion facility that includes an $850 million revolving line of credit and a $250 million term loan, each of which have a five-year maturity. It’s an excellent outcome for us in what was a challenging banking environment during the quarter. And that speaks to the quality of Casey’s as a credit risk and to the strength of our balance sheet. At April 30, we had $379 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. And with the recent refinancing, we now have an additional $875 million in undrawn borrowing capacity on existing lines of credit, giving us ample liquidity of $1.3 billion. Furthermore, we have no significant maturities coming due until our fiscal 2026. Our leverage ratio as calculated in accordance with our senior notes is 1.8 times EBITDA, and we continue to have ample capacity to make good strategic investments as they present themselves. For the quarter, net cash generated by operating activities of $245 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $175 million resulted in the company generating $70 million in free cash flow. We continue to see delays in the delivery of vehicles and construction time to remain elongated, thus deferring some of our planned capital spend into fiscal ’24. At the June meeting, the Board of Directors voted to increase the dividend of $0.43 per share per quarter, and that’s a 13% increase, marking the 24th consecutive year that the dividend has been increased. We will continue to remain balanced in our capital allocation going forward focusing on driving EBITDA growth with ROIC accretive investment opportunities in front of us. The company is providing the following fiscal 2024 outlook. Casey’s expects the following performance during fiscal ’24. We currently expect inside same-store sales to increase 3% to 5%. We expect inside margin improvement to approximately 40% to 41%. The company expects same-store fuel gallons sold to be between negative 1% to positive 1%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase approximately 5% to 7%, and that’s inclusive of adding 110 stores in fiscal ’24. As a reminder, this is inclusive of non-recurring operating expense benefits from FY ’23 regarding a legal settlement. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $55 million. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $340 million. And the purchase of property and equipment is expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 26% for the year. Consistent with our past practice, we’re not guiding to a CPG figure nor are we providing EPS or EBITDA. But for model calibration purposes, fuel margin in the mid-30s, along with flat retail prices of fuel compared to fiscal ’23, would result in a flat EBITDA year-over-year. Our first quarter-to-date experience is as follows: inside same-store sales are consistent with achieving the midpoint of our fiscal ’24 guidance; same-store gallons sold are near the low end of our fiscal ’24 outlook; fuel CPG margin for May was in the low-40s, however, were currently in the low-30s. I would now like to turn the call back over to Darren.\",\n                \"sequence\": 1\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Darren Rebelez\",\n                \"message\": \"Thanks, Steve. I’d like to again say thank you and congratulations to the entire Casey’s team for delivering another record year. The results speak for themselves and are a reflection of the hard work of the team and their dedication to executing our three-year strategic plan. In January of 2020, we laid out a plan to reinvent the guest experience, create capacity through efficiencies, be where the guest is, all while investing in our talent. As this plan is now ready for renewal, I’d like to share some of our accomplishments. Our team had to navigate through the global pandemic and the effects therein, including restricted traffic, labor shortages in an inflationary environment. We adapted to the situation and thrived in it, as you can see with our results. We reinvented the guest experience in several ways, but we really shined with our Casey’s Rewards program. We made a commitment to enhance our brand and drive digital engagement, and we did just that with over 6.5 million members through May of 2023. And this helped drive results as our same-store inside sales were at the high-end of our guidance. We wanted to make sure that we create capacity to invest in the business by capturing efficiencies while we grew. The team worked exceptionally hard to make the stores work harder for us, culminating in reducing same-store labor hours in fiscal ’23 by over 2%, while keeping team members engaged and guests satisfied. As shown in the financial results too is our operating expense CAGR of 12% was lower than our EBITDA CAGR of 14%. We also made a commitment to be where the guest is through accelerated unit growth. We came into the plan with an expectation that we would build more than we bought, but as the M&A environment changed, we were able to remain flexible with our two-pronged approach in over 70% of our new units from fiscal ’21 to ’23 or via acquisition. We made a bold commitment to accelerate our growth and we exceeded our own high standard of 345 new units ending the three-year period with 354 new stores. As you can see, our business has performed exceptionally well in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Casey’s has shown tremendous resiliency and we’re positioned especially well to deliver future value to our shareholders through our strategic plan, which is being enhanced with our commitment to technology. This was all made possible by making investments in the talent at Casey’s. Our investment in a standalone M&A team drove record growth. Centralized procurement helped keep our shelves stocked at lower costs despite supply chain challenges, centralized fuel operations allowed us to balance fuel volume and margin and countless other teams within the organization help make these last three years some of the most successful in the history of the company. We did all of this and generated cash flow from operations of approximately $2.5 billion, which was considerably higher than our capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion. As we reflect on our last strategic plan and our fiscal ’23 and beyond, I’m thrilled in Casey’s ability to succeed in any macro-economic condition. We’re excited to share our next three-year strategic plan on June 27 as we host our Investor Day in New York. We’ll lay out our plans to continue to grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders.\",\n                \"sequence\": 2\n            }\n        ],\n        \"relationships\": [\n            \"Steve is the CFO and Darren Rebelez is the President and Chief Executive Officer.\"\n        ],\n        \"summary\": \"Casey's General Stores, Inc. reported strong Q4 2023 financial results, exceeding expectations despite macroeconomic challenges.

And then, what you’re kind of thinking through on the actual prepared food commodity cost pressures?

Yeah, I’ll go ahead and start and let Steve fill in some of the detail. We expect to see a bit of recovery in overall inside margin, and we would see that primarily in prepared foods. And we think that’s for a couple of reasons. We’re expecting the inflationary pressure that we’ve experienced over the last year-and-a-half to settle down a bit. We’re currently experiencing some favorability on cheese costs as an example, which, as you know, is a big input to our prepared food and dispensed beverage margin. So that we expect to continue to improve throughout the year. On the grocery and general merch side, we started to see some of that inflation subside. There is still some categories like chips and candy, where we’re experiencing some inflation. But outside of that, there has been some moderation there. And so, we’ll still remain diligent in terms of passing on pricing that’s appropriate. And on the prepared food side, we’ll be a little more cautious on that effort on the commodity side, because we don’t want to whipsaw the guest and we want to make sure we maintain a relative value proposition. Steve, any color to that?\",\n                \"sequence\": 3\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Steve Bramlage\",\n                \"message\": \"Karen, for modeling purposes, I think I would advised that, grocery and GM, to Darren’s point, probably flattish margin-wise year-over-year for all of those reasons. And the preponderance of the inside improvement will come from prepared food. And that’s both on the cheese side, we’re about 43% hedged right now for our fiscal ’24 requirements. And at the current cheese prices, we’re kind of looking at least for the first quarter, down about 10% or so year-over-year. So we’ll get some tailwind there. We’ll also be lapping some significant price increases we’ve had this year. For example, donut inflation this year was 40% in the bakery category, and we’ll lap that during the first part of fiscal ’24.

We could pull that activity out of the stores and move it upstream where we could do it more efficiently. And so, we’ve been on a concerted effort over the last year to do exactly that. We’ve been able to reduce the number of unproductive hours as we would call it, and take those out. And in fact, our overall satisfaction scores as we measure them through a third-party have actually improved while we’ve done that because we’ve not only freed up those hours and taken some of that to the bank, but we’ve also given some of those hours back to the store so they can focus more on the guest experience. So we feel very comfortable with where we’re at now. And again, for this next fiscal year, we still have our continuous improvement team in place.

It’s been a little bit choppy. As we go into this year, obviously, there’s a lot of macroeconomic headwinds going on that could have an impact on gallons to the negative. At the same time, we do think that because we’ve outperformed our relevant benchmarks in our geography, we think we have some potential to grow gallons as well. So we’re trying to be appropriately conservative. We’ve given ourselves some room to grow gallons in the guidance and also are being somewhat pragmatic about the fact that if we go into a recession and the economy changes that we could see some softness. It’s just a little bit too early to tell.

And so this would be the third year in a row that we’re cycling really aggressive comps. We’re not expecting a lot on the pricing side from inflation, particularly in prepared foods. We took a lot of price last year to cover commodity costs. And so, we’re trying to maintain more of a relevant value proposition for our guests, especially as the economy starts to tighten. On the grocery and general merch side, we’re still going to see some inflationary impact from tobacco, and that’s just kind of normal course.

And in fact, when we look at alcohol in the beer category in particular, we’re expecting that to be a little more price competitive this summer with some temporary price reductions from the manufacturers.

On gallons, I guess — I could start with fourth quarter. Our gallons were flat in the quarter by the Mid-Continent OPIS data that we saw gallons were down about 2.5% for that same three-month period. So, from that perspective, I would say that even though we were flat, we’re probably taking share versus some others in our geography. One of the dynamics that we’re seeing that’s impacting gallon volume is a softness in diesel fuel volume, and that’s really a result of what we’ve seen happen in the economy over the last few months with softening retail sales, construction starts kind of slowing down and so you’re just seeing less trucks on the road. So we saw a reduction in our diesel volume low single-digits. And now that’s only 14% of our fuel mix, but when it’s down, it does have an impact. Now on the gasoline side, we are seeing a bit of an increase. So when you mix all that out, it came out flat in the quarter, but that’s what’s really driving some of the softness right now that we’re seeing.\",\n                \"sequence\": 8\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Bonnie Herzog\",\n                \"message\": \"Okay.

So we really feel good about the contribution that — and that mix has grown about 100 basis points from the same period last year.

In fact, we saw over 80% growth in chips and took about 500 basis points in share in the most recent quarter in our chip category, and we’re also seeing a lot of good success in bottled water.

It’s really widened that price delta between the two.

Sure. Irene, I’ll go ahead and start with the consumer. I’ll let Steve\\ntalk to M&A. With the consumer, I think we all recognize that the economy\\nstarted to soften a bit and so we started to see some consumer behavior from a\\nmore macro perspective. When you look at our consumer base, I’ll just remind\\neverybody that a couple of things. One, about three quarters of our consumers\\nearn over $50,000 a year. And that’s significant in the fact that — of the\\ngeography that we operate in, the most expensive state we operate in is ranked\\n22nd in terms of cost of living. And seven of the bottom 10 states are in our\\ngeography. So, $50,000 goes a lot further in our geography than in many others\\naround the country. So with that as a backdrop, what we’re seeing from the\\nconsumer in our stores is pretty consistent behavior for that group, that three\\nquarters of the group that are earning $50,000 or more, not any real significant\\nshifts in buying behavior. With the group that’s — that other 25%, call it, that’s earning less than\\n$50,000 a year, we are seeing some shifts certainly shifting more towards\\nprivate label. Reducing some of discretionary purchases, think lottery and some\\nnice cream novelty, that sort of thing, but they’re also shifting those purchases\\nover to more affordable indulgence like candy. We’re also starting to see some\\nbehavior where they’re leaning a little more into our freezer section of buying\\nindividual meals and that may be in lieu of going to a QSR occasion as well. So,\\nwe are seeing a bit of that shifting around the store. But again, our traffic has been positive. So, we haven’t seen any sort of\\nbehavior that would suggest that the consumers not shopping, and this is one of\\nthe beauties of our business model. We sell basic needs for people. And so,\\nthese are things that people have to have. And so they’re going to continue to\\ncome. They’re just made behave a little bit differently. But at this point, it’s\\nreally been the low income consumer that’s been most impacted.\",\n                \"sequence\": 7\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Steve Bramlage\",\n                \"message\": \"And Irene, on the M&A side, [Indecipherable] the pipeline, I think, remains\\nquite robust as we sit here today in terms of the things that we’re looking at,\\nwe feel good about that.

Listen, there’s a higher cost of financing for sure, associated with\\nanybody who does a deal, and I think that’s generally a good thing for us. I\\nthink potentially marginal buyers are sidelined quicker. Certainly, non-\\nstrategic buyers have largely been sidelined for many of the potential processes\\nthat we’re looking at where there’s no longer a kind of a cost of financing\\nadvantage and then they just don’t have any synergies to bring to bear.

We’re kind of two-thirds or so locked in the third quarter — or in the first quarter, I’m sorry, and then it progressively goes down from there.

It’s just, John, that we just had some wholesale cost increases and decreases, and it has been volatile. And then of course, we’re not alone in this. There’s a competitive set. And so, we have to stay competitive with others in the market. And sometimes that overall dynamic between cost increases and competitive pricing posture allows us to make more margin in some situations and less margin in others. And so, we’ve had — it’s probably been a little bit more extreme month to month than we would see historically. I would just point you to the last four months, the three months in our last fiscal quarter and then May. Two of those months were in the low 30s, two of those months are in 40s. And so, typically, the spread is not that much, but I’d say there’s nothing unusual in the world that’s driving that, just continued competitive activity and wholesale cost fluctuations.\",\n                \"sequence\": 8\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"John Royall\",\n                \"message\": \"Okay.

Hey, John, this is Steve. I think, from a working capital perspective relative to where we were in the prior year, a lot of our working capital change is just going to be driven by the price of fuel. So right, as the wholesale value of fuel goes up and a particular period that’s going to show up, right, as an increase in inventories for us and it’s going to show up as an increase in payables and then it’s going to go the opposite direction. And so, the single biggest impact on our working capital change both in the prior year 12-month period was a big change in the wholesale cost of fuel, and it was the same this year, it just happened to be going in the other direction. There is nothing substantially different happening in the business. We generally, as we add units, our working capital positive, just based on the timing with which we procure fuel and have to pay for fuel and receive credit card payments. And so, adding a bunch of units at the very end of the period this year will have a differentiating impact on working capital if we add units at a different pace in the prior year as well.\",\n                \"sequence\": 10\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Jessica Taylor\",\n                \"message\": \"Good morning.

So, we are seeing some of that. From a supplier perspective, it really depends on the type of supplier in the industry and the categories that they’re in. I think we’re seeing an interesting mix of some suppliers that still believe they have the ability to pass on more price. And so, we are seeing a little bit of that. That has certainly moderated from where it was a year ago. We see others, like I mentioned before, in the beer category who are looking to be a little more aggressive this year, and we expect them to be battling over share.
