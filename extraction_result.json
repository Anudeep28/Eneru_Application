We began 2024 with the strategic priorities of infusing AI into more of our products and tools, transforming and expanding our sales force and integrating Moritex, our largest acquisition in company history. I am pleased with the progress we made against these strategic priorities in 2024. We expanded our portfolio of machine vision products powered by world class AI. A couple of highlights include the industry's first AI enabled 3D smart camera, the In-Sight L38 and the addition of the Modular Vision Tunnel portfolio featuring the powerful DataMan 380 barcode reader that uses improved decoding optimized for logistics applications to minimize footprint, maximize depth of field, and read the smallest codes. We successfully executed our sales transformation, deploying a new type of Salesnoid to broaden our sales reach to customers we have not traditionally served, and we successfully integrated our largest ever acquisition, Moritex, which gives us a more complete machine vision solution and contributes positively to our bottom line. This transaction was accretive to adjusted EPS in 2024, which led to a slight increase in adjusted EPS for the year in an otherwise soft market. In 2024, our logistics and semiconductor businesses gained moment, but conditions across our broader factory automation business remained challenging. Most of these markets stabilize throughout the year. Despite a slight improvement in relevant macro leading indicators such as PMI, we still characterize our core factory automation markets as soft but stable for now. The exception continues to be automotive where we saw a pronounced step down in 2024. Coming into the year, we expected automotive to grow helped by significant EV battery spending, but this investment dropped off throughout the year, leading automotive to be our weakest end market in 2024. We continue to see uncertainty in auto as we begin 2025. These mixed market dynamics led to overall revenue growth of 9%, or 1% excluding Moritex for the full year. Throughout 2024, while we continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives, we stay disciplined in our approach to discretionary spending and thoughtful about hiring. I now want to provide you with a more detailed update on our strategic initiatives. We are seeing rapid changes in technology with powerful chips accelerating AI innovation. For industrial machine vision, this means moving beyond the world of rules based algorithms toward a more sophisticated suite of powerful artificial intelligence tools. Transformer models are overtaking convolutional neural networks as the foundation of deep learning. As this shift accelerates, customers will need significantly less data to train and configure our products, and we'll be able to ramp up and scale production faster. This will allow machine vision to address more applications and reach more customers. Cognex is defining the leading edge of this shift in industrial machine vision technology by launching industry-leading products that leverage AI to solve customer problems. Our new products address the full spectrum of machine vision applications.\",\n                \"sequence\": 4\n            }\n        ],\n        \"relationships\": [\n            \"Operator, Nathan McCurren, Robert J.

In December, we launched VisionPro Deep Learning 4.0 illustrated on Page 4 of our presentation. This powerful software designed to tackle the most difficult problems in machine vision is Cognex's first ever product to utilize transformer models. Transformer technology, which forms the core of sophisticated large language models, such as ChatGPT, can help to vastly reduce the number of images required to train and implement a machine vision model. VisionPro Deep Learning 4.0 signature few sample mode achieves high levels of accuracy on some of the most sophisticated inspections after training on as few as 10 images. Previous versions would have required hundreds of images to train a vision model with such capability. This is very valuable for customers who require high accuracy, but do not have large training datasets, which is often the case as they scale up their production. It is also important for customers whose production cycles are only a few months long and therefore require effective models to be ready in weeks. Few sample mode saves customers time collecting, labeling, and managing image data, which has historically been a costly process. We have also expanded our DataMan series to address more applications for customers looking for easy to use products. As illustrated on Page 5, our new DataMan series makes identifying and tracking parts and packages across the facility easier than ever. Regardless of industry, code quality, or application complexity, embedded AI in these next generation readers helps deliver exceptional read rates for reliable performance at every stage of production. Our latest DataMan products are examples of the products that allow us to get a highly advanced powerful technology into the hands of customers with less machine vision experience. We continue to tap into this broader customer base by investing to transform and expand sales coverage. Moving to Page 6 of the earnings presentation, we are enthusiastic about the progress of our sales transformation in 2024. Our first class of new Salesnoids continue to ramp with Q4 representing their highest quarter of bookings to date, leading to over 3000 new customers acquired by this group in 2024. These entry-level Salesnoids are also continuing to gain strong traction in referrals with more complex vision systems to our more technical and advanced Salesnoids. The second cohort of new Salesnoids entered the field recently, and we expect this to further grow our customer base in 2025. We remain confident in the long-term value of our sales transformation strategy, allowing us to serve more customers with easy-to-use products. We're excited to continue this strategy and introduce a new cohort of Salesnoids each year. As we plan for future years, we will be flexible about cohort sizes and be responsive to market conditions. Turning now to what we are seeing across our end markets, which you will find on Page 7 of the earnings presentation, I will discuss the end market results for the year, excluding the contribution of Moritex. End markets have been mixed as we have seen both continued softness as well as pockets of growth. Starting with logistics, revenue grew 20% in 2024. We continue to see broad moment in logistics from global e-commerce leaders as well as regional e-commerce, retail and parcel, and post providers. Market growth has improved as large e-commerce players returned to capacity expansion, and broader logistics remains an under-penetrated market. We believe we also gain share with recent product innovations, including the success of the Modular Vision Tunnel and DataMan 380 launched last year. Moving on to automotive, revenue in automotive was down 14% year on year. We continue to see declines in EV battery investment and tentativeness in large capital projects across the broader automotive business. Coming into the year, we expected strong growth in EV battery investment and for it to be one of our largest growth engines. But as the year progressed, we saw delays, reductions, and cancellations of EV battery projects. We still expect EV battery to be a long-term growth driver but likely not in 2025. Consumer electronics revenue was down 5% year on year as smartphone design changes remain limited and we saw conservative capex spending across the market. Consumer electronics has positive long-term trends. Currently our expectations for near-term investment in consumer electronics are tempered, but we tend to have a better line of sight to this by early Q2 each year. So we will give you another update on our next earnings call. Lastly, semi is continuing to build with significant year-on-year growth albeit off a low 2023 base. Growth is widespread across semi with investment increases from major machine builders, but we have seen strong demand driven by high bandwidth memory chip investments. As we kick off 2025, we expect moment to continue in logistics and semi, automotive to remain weak, and other factory automation growth to be relatively in line with macro indicators such as PMI. We continue to see disruptive trends playing out in our markets. AI technology is making our products more accessible to an increasing number of customers and applications. We lead the industry in making machine vision technology usable by industrial customers at scale. With this, we can automate more inspection tasks and grow the machine vision market both by solving more of our sophisticated customer's most challenging problems, but also by making our powerful technology accessible for those less experienced in automation. Let me now hand it over to Dennis to walk you through the financial results and the outlook for the first quarter.\",\n                \"sequence\": 1\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Dennis Fehr\",\n                \"message\": \"Thank you, Rob. Our quarterly financial highlights can be found on Page 8 of our earnings presentation posted to our investor website yesterday. Fourth-quarter revenue of $230 million finished at the high end of our guidance range and increased 17% year on year. Excluding Moritex, revenue grew by 12%. As we have now passed the one year anniversary of the close of our Moritex acquisition, I will note that this will be the last quarter we speak to revenue trends excluding this part of our business. From a geographic viewpoint, excluding Moritex, year-on-year revenue grew double digits in both the Americas, led by continued logistics strength and compounded by accelerated demand in the quarter and in other Asia led by semiconductor. Europe declined slightly due to weaker automotive spending. Year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter was strongest in Greater China, driven by project timing in consumer electronics as well as an easy year-ago comparison. While China revenue has grown year on year the past two quarters, we remain cautious about the overall outlook for this market, which continues to see both significant uncertainty and heightened competitive pressures. Turning to margins, adjusted gross margin was 69.4% in Q4, down 130 basis points from 70.7% a year ago, driven by Moritex, negative mix from higher logistics revenue, and to a lesser extent, pricing headwinds most pronounced in China. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year on year in the quarter. The increase was driven by Moritex as well as investment in our sales force transformation and expansion. As a result of reallocation and adjustment to our employee base, we incurred $3 million of reorganization costs in the quarter that are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Even with our investment in Salesforce expansion, ending headcount for this year was 3% below year-ago levels and we continue to focus on tight cost management. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.5% in Q4, above the high end of our guidance and up nearly 6 percentage points from 12.6% a year ago. Revenue growth and tight cost management drove high incremental EBITDA margin despite gross margin pressure. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.16, up from $0.07 in Q4 of 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.20, up from $0.11 year on year. Both increases were due to higher revenue and higher margins. Driven by working capital optimization, we delivered strong free cash flow for the second quarter in a row in Q4, totaling $49 million compared to $7 million in Q4 of 2023. Cognex returned $57 million to shareholders in the quarter. $43 million of share repurchase was our highest quarterly total since Q1 2022, and we intend to continue to be opportunistic with our stock buyback. I will also briefly cover our full year 2024 results, which can be found on Page 9 of our presentation. 2024 revenue of $915 million grew 9% year on year, or 1% excluding Moritex. Geographically, for the full year, excluding Moritex, other Asia delivered the highest revenue growth due to semi. In addition, the Americas grew moderately, Europe declined slightly, and China declined more materially in the year. Adjusted gross margin was 69.3% in 2024, down 3.2 percentage points due to Moritex's unfavorable mix and, to a lesser extent, pricing. For the full year, adjusted operating expense increased 6%, driven primarily by Moritex as well as our sales force transformation efforts. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 140 basis points to 17.1% in 2024 due to lower gross margins and higher operating expense associated with our sales transformation. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.62 declined 6% year on year, partially due to a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 was up from $0.73 in 2023 as the accretion from Moritex offset softness in factory automation for the full year. Total free cash flow in flow in 2024 was $134 million, representing 105% conversion of adjusted net income. We returned $119 million to our shareholders in the year and ended the year with $587 million in cash and investments and no debt. I will now turn to our outlook for the first quarter on Page 10 of our presentation. In the first quarter, we expect revenue between $200 million and $220 million. This range continues to be reflective of a mixed and volatile macro backdrop. At the midpoint, this represents revenue in line with Q1 2024, reflecting our expectation of continued growth in logistics and semiconductor, offset by weaker automotive and an approximately $5 million FX headwind. The expected sequential step-down is driven by the acceleration in demand from customers in Q4 and an anticipated $4 million FX headwind in the first quarter. We also expect adjusted gross margin to remain in the high 60% range. Sequentially, mix is expected to be a slight headwind. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin between 12% and 15%. The midpoint of this range represents 150 basis point increase year on year, driven by operating leverage and operating expense discipline. Lastly, we are excited to hold our Cognex Investor Day this year on June 9th and June 10th at our Boston area headquarters, and we hope to see you there. Now we will open the call for questions.

We\\\\'ve onboarded and got up to improve the productivity of\\na large first cohort of emerging customer salespeople. Their performance in Q4 I think was in line or better than what we had expected\\nand communicated to you at the last call. They\\\\'ve completed over 80,000 customer\\nvisits in 2024, adding over 3000 customers, achieving bookings right around $1\\nmillion a week. And then referring significant business to the rest of our sales\\nteam, that\\\\'s turning into larger and more sophisticated opportunities for\\ncustomers. So we\\\\'re really starting to see much better penetration of the\\nmarket, but this is just the beginning. And we hired the second cohort, as we went through last year and they\\\\'re now\\nentering the field. And they\\\\'re going to really help us expand our sales\\ncoverage. So I think we can sort of be cutting and pasting the numbers we saw\\nwith the first cohort, but hopefully doing better because we\\\\'re getting better,\\nand we\\\\'re understanding how to do this more. And then I would say, I think as I\\ncommunicated, we\\\\'ve adjusted how we\\\\'re managing them and what we\\\\'re doing based\\non what we\\\\'ve learned. And so they\\\\'re better integrated with our existing sales force now and so better\\nable to cover accounts, some larger accounts where we\\\\'ve been really under-\\npenetrated. They\\\\'re making more calls on different customer profiles within\\nthose large accounts. And then we\\\\'re also giving them really great new\\ntechnology. And I think the best example would be the DataMan 290 and 390 series\\nthat is now in their hands. Great AI technology that\\\\'s easy to sell and easy to use. And this sales force\\nwas designed with technology like that in mind. So that\\\\'s our playbook that we\\nwill continue to iterate on with -- as we go through future cohorts. In terms of\\nother things, the business that we\\\\'re winning is -- has over 75% gross margin. So again, as we expected in that regard.

So that I just get your sales over time can be less cyclical versus some of the\\nmarkets that you focus on. So wondering if there\\\\'ll be a pivot there over time.\\nAnd then I guess my second question, obviously you\\\\'re still sitting with a very\\nstrong balance sheet sitting in net cash with Moritex behind you. I\\\\'m just\\nwondering what your appetite is or the environment is for acquisitions in 2025\\nrelative to where we sat in sat in 2024. Thank you.\",\n                \"sequence\": 8\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Robert J. Willett\",\n                \"message\": \"Yes. Thank you. Let me talk about our markets and how we think about that and\\nvolatility and opportunity within them first, and then I\\\\'ll ask Dennis to\\naddress the second part of your question about capital. So we\\\\'ll give you an\\nupdate on our view of our served markets in June at the Analyst Day. I think -- look forward to sharing that with you and our view about how we\\nexpand them. Obviously, we did expand with the acquisition of Moritex and\\nadjacencies and other markets we\\\\'re moving into that where we see opportunities\\nto grow that service market, and we\\\\'ll give you more color on on that. In terms\\nof kind of where our interests lie and kind of where -- how to think about\\nvolatility within those markets, we see our logistics market is still our\\nlargest served market and the one we expect to grow fastest. Now that was true\\nwhen we last gave you an update, and it\\\\'s still true today very much that there\\nwas a growth market for us and will continue to be a great focus of innovation\\nand investment. And so that\\\\'s exciting and witness the Modular Vision Tunnel, the progress we\\\\'re\\nmaking with parcel and post companies. Our great success with the technology\\nleaders in that space, and we think that has a long way to run. In terms of\\nother markets, what I would say is, I think we all understand that Cognex is\\nhighly indexed on the technology leaders and the big leaders in the premier\\ncustomers in our markets whether it\\\\'s automotive or consumer electronics. And\\nthose tend to have more -- they have -- tend to put more volatility into our\\nbusiness overall. But our emerging customer initiative really allows us to broaden our customer\\nbase, going from serving about 30,000 customers as we do to going down more into\\nmore mid-tier and more entry-level customers and really broadening that. So we\\nwould expect that to take some volatility out of our business in future. And\\nwith volatility, you can see that we can underperform in difficult periods and\\noutperform as I think we did in the fourth quarter as a result of some very\\nstrong relationships we have and some very good markets, but that\\\\'s not ideal in\\nterms of running a stable business. And I think the emerging customer program\\nallows us to do that quite well. You asked about other markets, medical, which is a big bag of medical\\nbusinesses, including pharmaceutical, life science, medical device representing\\nabout 10% of our business overall. Those markets haven\\\\'t been good over the last\\nfew years since COVID. Confident I think everyone is that they will return to\\ngrowth, and that\\\\'s the type of market again where we will be having much more\\nsales activity as a result of our emerging customer sales force and much more\\nappropriate products for the level of technical expertise that those industries\\nhave to adopt. And so I would expect over time that we would see smaller\\nmarkets, packaging-related, medical, even aerospace markets where we\\\\'ve been\\nvery underpenetrated. But we\\\\'re seeing some nice progress in terms of activity and as those markets\\nrecover, hopefully a broader base of customers with less volatility.\",\n                \"sequence\": 9\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Dennis Fehr\",\n                \"message\": \"Let me take it from here in regards to the M&A question.

And to give you a sense of the magnitude of that, I think\\ncoming in, we had -- we\\\\'re aggressive at Cognex. We had stretch goals to really\\ndrive a lot of business into EV battery where we have just some great\\ntechnology. And I think where we ended up relative to where we came on was on the order of\\n$50 million delta. So that was the most difficult thing that we encountered\\ncoming into the year. Obviously, that continued as the year went along. Now we\\nthink it\\\\'s going to continue to be a bad year for automotive. But I don\\\\'t think on the order of decline that we saw in 2024. There are some\\nreasons to be optimistic about automotive. We do great things in automotive when\\nEV battery comes back, when capacity is more utilized and investment returns and\\nwhat we\\\\'re able to do in that space is very good. And certainly Cognex\\\\'s\\ntechnology in the area of sensors on the car, electronics in the car, and some\\nof our new technology, what it can do in inspection in the car is our exciting\\ngrowth areas for us.

There are reasons that we feel confident that in the long run consumer\\nelectronics is -- will be a great growth market for us and will continue to be.\\nThe issue is always on when do these things occur. There are a lot of great new\\nfeatures planned, a lot of innovation coming, whether it\\\\'s in smartphones or in\\nwearable devices or in other electronics such as augmented reality, virtual\\nreality type technology that I think many of our customers are working hard to\\ntry to bring to market.

There\\\\'s also a lot of human inspection going on in consumer electronics\\nmanufacturing. And if I refer you to some of the comments I made in my prepared\\nremarks earlier, our newer technology, particularly transformer technology,\\nallows us to meet the needs of some of those customers very well by allowing\\nthem to implement our technology quickly and to get great results, which make\\npayback much, much faster. And to give you a little context of that, if you\\nthink of electronics, often it\\\\'s a very, very rapid scaling up in a relatively\\nshort period of manufacturing at huge scale.

US, Europe, other Asia, and then\\nas we look in terms of customer tiers, I would say, we\\\\'re -- we made good\\nprogress in base based logistics, seeing some nice growth in that space. We\\\\'ve made great progress with very large e-commerce players. And then as you\\nmight expect there\\\\'s sort of a group more large customers, some of whom didn\\\\'t\\ngrow with us last year. And others of them did. Specifically in the US, a couple\\nof customers who I think are struggling with their own retail supply chain and\\nexecution of various things, didn\\\\'t put up growth. But that\\\\'s -- those are really very few exceptions to what is a very broad and\\nunderlying return to growth. We\\\\'re positive, very positive about our logistics\\nbusiness and what we\\\\'re seeing happening.

But there\\\\'s much, much more to be done, and we\\\\'re seeing more and more traction\\nwith that. New customer activity is strong. We\\\\'re bringing more data management\\nwith our edge intelligence platform to this space. And then as you rightly note,\\nthe parcel and post sector is an area where we see growth in. I did spend a lot of last week in Europe visiting a lot of parcel and post\\nbusinesses in that space. I would say, they\\\\'re not overly enthusiastic about the\\ninvestment environment in parcel and post currently, but I don\\\\'t think that is\\ngoing to be a headwind to our opportunity to grow in that space. These are\\nreally new customers for us, newer technologies, so we\\\\'re coming off a low base\\nand we have a lot to offer. But it\\\\'s worth keeping in mind some of those\\npossible and post companies have five-year capital spending plan that we\\\\'ve been\\nstarting to muscle in on now for a number of years.

And at the same time, I think there's probably a lot further to discuss where probably doesn't have the time right now. But I'm really looking forward to continue a bit more in this conversation at our Investor Day, so we can talk then a bit more about like, hey, what could be potential markets, how do we think about like the balance sheet in that regard. So a lot of good topics to cover there, and I think we'll address these at Investor Day.\",\n                \"sequence\": 1\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Jamie Cook\",\n                \"message\": \"Thank you.

And I think every manufacturer in America is thinking very much about the risks and upside associated with with tariffs and other actions that are going on. I would put a little in the context though that there's just a huge amount of uncertainty and confusion. So I think it's not -- that interest isn't really leading to I think action at the moment. It's leading to confusion, and hopefully we'll see more clarity and then more more actually action. But maybe to give you a little context if we think about our Q4 performance and our Q1 guidance, I think there was a lot -- quite a lot of excitement and positivity that we saw in the back end of last year, really post-election in November and December, which did account for some higher spending, one in prior years I might have called it budget flush type spending that went on in November and December in Americas really only, I'd say. And I might size that about $6 million to $7 million of business that I think we received in Q4 as a result of that enthusiasm that really came straight out of Q1. So I think there's that. We do have FX is is I think a worry in general for companies where the strength of the US dollar is a $5 million or so headwind for us in Q1 as well. So -- and then there are a lot of policy changes obviously. If we were -- when we were talking a year ago, there was, a lot of enthusiasm about the Inflation Reduction Act and other things. Clearly, a lot of -- there's a lot more confusion about that. So certainly, that's all at play. I do think in -- if we see major investment in manufacturing and major onshoring going on in the United States, Cognex should be a major beneficiary of that given our strength in this market.\",\n                \"sequence\": 7\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Piyush Avasthy\",\n                \"message\": \"Helpful.

China certainly is an extremely competitive market for us and our customers. So I don't think there's much change to report from that situation in the last quarter, compared to what we're generally seeing. But China is a market where there are strong and emerging competitors in our industry and to us specifically. I think everyone's been seeing this as an extremely difficult market. Some of the larger players that we see, emerging state-owned enterprises have actually been cost cutting and reducing some of their spend. So certainly, they're feeling the sort of pain that we're seeing in that market. Our strategy, taking a leaf out of the innovator's dilemma, is we want to maintain share, and we want to maintain customers and share as we go through this in China. We have very strong technology and good gross margins even at difficult prices. So we're willing to take a hit to pricing to maintain share, and that's been the situation it continues to be. As we bring new technology to market, we're hopeful that we'll have bigger deltas that we can assert, the DataMan 290 being an example of something we might might see in that space. But I'd say, in terms of the pricing discussion, it's a very distant gross margin topic compared to some of the volume things that hit our gross margin or the diluted -- the dilution of Moritex, which we're getting to grips with and should improve also. Dennis, what would you add?\",\n                \"sequence\": 9\n            },\n            {\n                \"speaker\": \"Dennis Fehr\",\n                \"message\": \"Yes, no, absolutely. I think if you think about it both 2024 as a full year or Q1 and Q4 is specifically, I think really the biggest topics we have seen working in the gross margin is really Moritex and then mix effects like the strong growth of logistics. And it's also very clearly that volume plays a big role as well. So that means we have infrastructure and fixed costs right there. So higher volume or lower volume really drives leverage there. And then pricing is really the fourth item there in the stack, which is really to a lesser extent, but it's very clearly that we are seeing these dynamics and therefore wanted to be transparent and clear about what we are seeing.

We have a great reputation, and we cultivate the companies that -- small companies that we think are doing great work. ViDi is a great example of that. Really an excellent Swiss-based company with some phenomenal engineers doing things that when we really got to understand them, blew us away and we were delighted to acquire them. So I think that was eight years ago I guess, and I think probably that the general investor community saw the potential for advanced technology in manufacturing. So there are a lot of companies that were very heavily invested in the years following that time that are now I'd say for sale. And so there's a lot of them to see. But a note of caution is when we really get in and look at those companies, they may have raised $50 million of capital on a business plan to have sales of $30 million now, and their sales are 10% of that amount, and they're really more around consulting or other things. They really haven't achieved the potential that they expected. So I think the valuation of those companies is not what people thought they would be five years ago, which is an opportunity for Cognex because some of them have them have good technology they haven't been able to bring to market. But certainly, the realism about what they actually have and where they are is one I would say is a strong theme that I would observe. Overall, I think it kind of underscores that to play well in our market, it's not enough to have great technology. You have to understand customers. You have to have applications, engineers who really understand the application, and that's where the 3000 or so strong noids that we have who are out there every day, the 30,000 customers or so with the -- who knows? Some of them are the most sophisticated suppliers of technology. that's great opportunities for us to take technology and apply it, which isn't quite as easy as it might appear to someone who eight years ago launched off on a plan. So I'd say that's the current state of it. My hope is that some of those really good companies and great engineering teams will join Cognex over time.

And that\\\\'s\\nvery exciting. And here it\\\\'s worth pointing out that there\\\\'s a lot of great\\npublic technology from Silicon Valley kind of coming out of companies. But that technology isn\\\\'t ready for industrial application, and there\\\\'s a lot of\\nexpertise we have in taking publicly available models and applying them and\\nreally making them work. They don\\\\'t work well when just applied even with\\nexperienced programmers to our industry without deep domain and technology and\\ncustomer knowledge that we have. I think where this technology is also really\\nboth very exciting for us, but also will change our industry is it\\\\'s making\\nmachine vision much easier to apply and implement. And you can really see that\\nwe\\\\'re leading in that space as a result of applying technology in edge learning. Deep learning went to edge learning, and transformer models are in a way a\\nfuture that almost no learning. And that that is something that we do extremely\\nwell and are leading the industry in, but it will change the sale and it will\\nchange who we sell to and how we sell and what we provide for them. Less\\napplication engineering, more pure technology that they can implement. I would\\nsay I\\\\'m pretty optimistic about what that means for Cognex in the next few\\nyears. I don\\\\'t -- I think this -- the technology that you\\\\'re seeing coming out of\\nSilicon Valley is still going to be too hard to apply really to our customers.\\nAnd the people who are going to apply it first are going to be us, and we\\\\'re\\ngoing to see it kind of driving. And that\\\\'s -- I also feel really good about the\\nemerging customer salesforce we\\\\'re putting in place who can just get that\\ntechnology out to so many more users and sell it much more quickly than we have\\nbefore. So that\\\\'s the overall picture. But we\\\\'re a technology company. The business is always -- the technology is\\ngetting better and faster and easier to use.
